                    <h3>COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously 
                        been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. 
                        Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe 
                        illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain 
                        underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.</h3><br>

                    <h2>Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, Covid-19?</h2>
                    <h3>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the 
                        disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan 
                        China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. 
                        In COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. Formerly, this 
                        disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”</h3><br>

                    <h2>How does the virus spread?</h2>
                    <h3>COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including 
                        between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are 
                        infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection 
                        with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus 
                        spreads and the severity of illness it causes.</h3>

                    <h3>COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person 
                        to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than 
                        influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses 
                        known to affect people.</h3>

                    <h2>Is it okay for me to donate blood?</h2>
                    <h3>
                        In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential 
                        part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are 
                        open and in urgent need of donations. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
                        encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they 
                        are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by 
                        providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these 
                        recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to 
                        environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead 
                        of time.
